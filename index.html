    <h1 style="text-align: center;">All You Need to Know About Beavers!</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The beaver, a remarkable mammal, stands out for its ability to mold the environment, a trait that is rare in the animal kingdom and parallels human ingenuity.<br>
        Fascinated by their complex abilities, I chose beavers for our project to delve into the evolution of their unique skill set.<br>
        Beavers sculpt their surroundings by constructing dams and lodges, using a combination of natural materials and remarkable engineering tactics. <br>
        This process creates wetlands, which serve as biodiversity hotspots and contributes to ecological health.<br>
        As natural engineers, beavers use their sharp teeth and powerful tails to fell trees and build, reflecting an evolutionary response to survival needs. <br>
        Their structures are feats of precision and durability, evidencing advanced problem-solving and social cooperation.<br>
        These dams provide safety for their colonies and maintain wetland ecosystems, showcasing the beavers' pivotal role in their habitats. By studying beavers, <br>
        we gain insight into environmental engineering that predates human intervention, opening a window into the symbiotic relationship between species and their habitats.<br>
        Through understanding beavers, we can appreciate the intricate balance of nature and the evolutionary paths that lead to such profound environmental influences.

            "Their teeth never stop growing. Chewing on tree trunks and branches helps keep their teeth from getting too long.",
            "Beavers slap their tails against the water to warn others of danger, effectively communicating with their colony.",

            "A beaver's lodge has underwater entrances, making it difficult for predators to breach.",
            "Beavers are monogamous and are known to live with their mate for life.",
            "The largest beaver dam ever recorded was found in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada, and it measured 850 meters long.",
            "They use a combination of sticks, mud, and rocks to construct their dams, and the sound of running water can trigger a beaver to start building."
